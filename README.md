A re-design of the Saint Laurent YSL website in PHP MySQL

To set this web application, make sure PHP and PHPMyAdmin are installed in your server.
Next open PHPMyAdmin, create a database called db. Create a table named users and enter 6 columns named id (auto_increment, primary key) fname, lname, email, username, and password.
The mysqli_connect class takes the parameter localhost for the hostname and root for the username with no password and db for database.
